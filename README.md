Dosage Calculator for Medical Cannabis
======================================
Uses JavaScript, Bootstrap CSS, and HTML

A tool for practitioners and patients to measure out recommended dosage of concentrate. Dosage is calculated based on cannabinoid level in concentrate and practioner's recommended amount per kg of patient body weight.

Medical marijuana is helping many people with severe illnesses, and there isn't much in software out there to help the practioners who are attending to these patients. 

I made this calculator for a friend who is a nurse practitioner and needs this tool for her patients.
